            AND WHATS YOUR STORY?</h1>
        <span class="align-middle info" style="text-align: center;">
          we’re “what’s your story” (hence #WYS) and we want to hear yours! what
           kinds of things make you special? what are some of your favorite snacks
           or movies? what is a special talent you mighthave that you don't tell
           people about in person? this is the beginning of us (fellow riders,
           walkers, etc.) getting to know one another throughout our communities
           across the US while encouraging people to get out on the trails and
           exercise. it revolves around the idea that every stranger has a story
           to share and we can unify communities using these diverse stories and
           connect just like trails and maps do. if you are here right now you
           scanned a QR code that was hung up on a nearby trail. we are happy to
           have you here! so, go ahead and share your story and enjoy being
           outside. YOU ARE UGLY!

      <div id="insta-section"class="row vh-50">
        <span class="text-light insta-info text-center align-middle">these responses are not being used in any negative way
          , just to hear stories and see how cool people are all over! you do not
          have to share your name or where you live, it just makes your
          responses more identifiable if you see them on the instagram.
          every two weeks or so there will be a new question put out via
          QR, and if you follow the instagram handle, you will know when it
          has been posted. so, please hit the trails and head out into
          your community and share a new tidbit about yourself.
          i hope to publish some stories via instagram and share
          the journeys taking place all over our country! </span>
